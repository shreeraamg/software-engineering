# Functional Programming Paradigm

In this paradigm, programs are composed of functions that take input and produce output without modifying the state of 
the program.

### Key Characteristics

- **Pure Functions** - Functions that always return the same output given the same inputs and have no side effects.
- **Immutability** - Data is never changed in place, but rather new data is created each time it's updated.
- **Functions as First-Class Citizens** - Functions can be passed as arguments to other functions, returned as values from functions and stored in data structures.
- **Higher-Order Functions** - Functions that take other functions as arguments or return functions as output.
- **Recursion** - A programming technique where functions call themselves to solve problems.

### Benefits
- Functional programs are often simpler and easier to understand.
- Immutable data and pure functions reduce the likelihood of bugs.

### Languages
- Scala
- Clojure
- Haskell
